A simple layer between Gothic 2 engine and it's virtual filesystem. Allows to obfuscate game assets (like textures, models, worlds, etc.) with a trivial XOR cipher. Created for some modders on their request in order to protect pre-releases of their mods. Features of the original closed-source `vdfs32g.dll` library were extended using the DLL spoofing technique.
